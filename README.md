                           Standard Procedure for C programming

1. Set up your development environment: Install a compiler and an editor.

2. Understand the problem: Analyze the problem and identify the input and output.

3. Design the algorithm: Sketch out the steps needed to solve the problem.

4. Write the code: Use the languageâ€™s syntax to write the code for the algorithm.

5. Compile the code: Use the compiler to create an executable version of the code.

6. Test the code: Run the code with sample input and check the output.

7. Debug the code: Find and fix bugs in the code.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 as needed: Continue to refine the code until it works correctly.

9. Document the code: Add comments to explain how the code works.


                                     Here are some key features of C programming:
                                  
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that was first developed in the early 1970s. It is considered one of the most widely used and influential programming languages in the world.

1.Low-level programming: C provides direct access to hardware and system resources, making it well-suited for system programming and embedded systems.

2.Portability: C code can run on a wide range of platforms and hardware architectures, making it a popular choice for cross-platform development.

3.Structured programming: C uses functions and control structures to organize code into manageable blocks, promoting readability and maintainability.

4.Pointers: C provides direct access to memory locations using pointers, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient data structures.

5.Preprocessor directives: C provides a preprocessor that processes code before compilation, allowing for macros, conditional compilation, and other advanced features.

6.Standard Library: C has a rich standard library, providing functions for input/output, string handling, mathematics, and more.
Performance: C is considered to be a fast and efficient language, making it well-suited for performance-critical applications.
